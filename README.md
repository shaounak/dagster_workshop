## Dagster Project for Redshift DDL Deployment

This project utilizes Dagster to deploy DDLs (Data Definition Language) to a Redshift database. It offers independent execution of DDLs within their designated directories while maintaining a specific execution order for the overall deployment.

### Project Structure

The project follows this directory structure:

```
Tables/
Foreign_Keys/
Seed_Data/
Comments/
Pipelines/
Delta_Scripts/
config.yaml  # Optional configuration file (explained later)
```

- **Tables/**: Contains DDL files for creating database tables.
- **Foreign_Keys/**: Stores DDL files defining foreign key relationships between tables.
- **Seed_Data/**: Holds scripts for populating tables with initial data.
- **Comments/**: (Optional) Includes DDL files for adding comments to existing objects.
- **Pipelines/**: (Optional) Houses DML files for pipelines metadata the PostGre database.
- **Delta_Scripts/**: (Optional) Contains DDL files used for performing delta updates on existing data.
- **config.yaml** (Optional): This file can be used to define configuration options such as the Redshift connection details.

**Key Points:**

- Each DDL within a directory can be executed independently.
- Scripts in **Tables/** are executed first, followed by parallel execution of **Foreign_Keys/** alongside **Seed_Data/**, **Comments/**, **Pipelines/**, and **Delta_Scripts/**.

### Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

- `dagster`
- `dagster-redshift`

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-redshift
```

### Configuration

The project can optionally utilize a `config.yaml` file to store configurations like the Redshift connection details.  The DDL directory path can also be specified within this file.

**Example config.yaml:**

```yaml
redshift:
  host: "your-redshift-host"
  port: 5439
  database: "your-redshift-database"
  user: "your-redshift-user"
  password: "your-redshift-password"

ddl_directory: "path/to/your/ddl/directory"  # Optional, defaults to current directory
```

**Note:** Sensitive information like passwords should be stored securely using environment variables or a dedicated secret management system.

### Usage

1. Clone this project or create a new project with the specified structure.
2. Update the `config.yaml` file with your Redshift connection details (optional).
3. Implement your DDL scripts within the designated directories.
4. Run the Dagster pipelines using the `dagster` command-line tool.

**Example (assuming pipelines are defined):**

```bash
dagster pipeline run execute_all_pipelines
```

This will trigger the execution of all defined Dagster pipelines, which in turn execute the DDLs in the specified order.

### Additional Notes

- Modify the Dagster pipeline definitions to leverage the `dagster-redshift` library for interacting with your Redshift database.
- Consider implementing error handling within your pipelines to ensure a smooth deployment process.
- Explore advanced Dagster features like schedules and sensors for automated deployments.

This project provides a basic framework for deploying DDLs to a Redshift database using Dagster. Feel free to customize it further to meet your specific needs.
